            So hola guys....What's up? Hope you all are doing well! <br />
            So i know you came here to learn programming and most of you can be
            here to utilize your time in programming during this pandemic! And
            if You are not from IT sector then you can go through
            <a href="#">this blog</a> to learn some basics of computer.<br />So..let's
            start!
          </h3>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div
          style="
            background-color: aliceblue;

          <h4>
            <q>Variables</q> is not a big word I guess. Let's take an
            illustration to understand this. <br />
            Consider that you have books, a lot, where would you store it?
            <div>
              <img
                src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qAZEfsurrXGuQ6QOCj6hgQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&w=251&h=168"
                alt="books images"
              />
            </div>
            You will say that you will store it in some container type
            thing,right?
            <img
              src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Z9CQ4az8g49sLs4RQVxxswHaE5&pid=Api&P=0&w=229&h=153"
              alt="books container"
            />
            Well, in the same manner variables can be defined.
            <br />
            Variables are the type of storage container where you can store
            different types of data.
            <img
              src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.2VavxPQLIPWKeGxqBC00DAHaLR&pid=Api&P=0&w=300&h=300"
              alt=""
            />
            Now, again a data can be of different types. It can be a mainly a
            number and a string.

            <label>Data Types</label>
            <h3>
              Following are the examples of some very common data types used in
              C:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  char: The most basic data type in C. It stores a single
                  character and requires a single byte of memory in almost all
                  compilers.
                  <br />
                  Example: Any alphabet whether uppercase or lowercase
                </li>

                <li>
                  int: As the name suggests, an int variable is used to store an
                  integer. Example:any integer value from -infinity to
                  +infinity,-388,+5893,etc.
                </li>

                <li>
                  float: It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with
                  floating point value) with single precision. Example:Any
                  floating point number,like 3.5,7.43,949.4997 etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  double: It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with
                  floating point value) with double precision.
                  Example:46.583987598,9589.3885895899,etc
                </li>
              </ul>
